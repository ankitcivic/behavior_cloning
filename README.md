The Scaled Autonomous Vehicles deals with the concepts involving building, running the scaled version of a race car autonomously in a certain desired track under the guidance of Dr. Venkat Krovi, Michelin Endowed Chair Professor of Vehicle Automation. The course is offered during the spring 2020 at Clemson University, CUICAR. We are a team of 3 automotive enthusiasts Ankit Verma, Naga Venkata Sai Teja Allam and Siddhesh Naresh Bhagkar eyed on achieving the level 3 autonomy with the scaled vehicle. The primary goal of the project is to achieve the level 3 autonomy by using CNN and end to end learning algorithms. The vehicle should autonomously perform the obstacle avoidance, lane keeping tasks tested in different tracks.
